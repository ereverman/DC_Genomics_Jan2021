# R Markdown


## need a few packages first,
```
install.packages("pacman")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("knitr")
# This is a package management tool that makes installing and loading streamlined
# especially good if you are sharing code and collaborators don't have the same packages installed as you
```

## Getting started:
* Open a new script and select .rmd
* When prompted to install new packages click yes
* name the file Example_Rmarkdown
* include your name as the author
* leave as html (we can generate the other files later)


## Three major parts:
* Title/header section
* Code chunks, denoted with ```
* Information, text

## Markdown itself is a simple coding language and most of the code is focused on formatting content
* Let's start off by deleting this text and making some notes.
