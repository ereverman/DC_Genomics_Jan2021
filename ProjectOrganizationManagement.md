### Data Tidiness:

# Questions:
1. What is metadata?
2. What metadata should I collect?
3. How should I structure my sequencing data and metadata?

# Objectives:
1. Think about and understand the types of metadata a sequencing experiment will generate.
2. Understand the importance of metadata and potential metadata standards.
3. Explore common formatting challenges in spreadsheet data.

## INTRODUCTION:
* Sequencing projects are long-term projects
  * It takes time to generate the raw sample material, do the molecular biology to make samples for sequencing, send samples for sequencing, and to process the seqyencing material.
  * There are lots of experiment-specific details to keep track of that are easy to forget.
  * Finding a clear, repeatable way to collect and store metadata (data about your data) is critically important.
  * Losing track of metadata can lead to the death of a project and loss of money, lab reagents, and your time.

# What are metadata and how do you keep them?
* Spreadsheet or table with data from your experiment and for what you were measuring
* Lab notebook notes about how you conducted experiments
* Spreadsheet/table about the samples you sent for sequencing
  * Sample name, DNA concentration, library type, etc.
 * Lab notebook notes about how amples are prepared for sequencing, what type of sequencing you are doing
